Welcome to my thesis repository. Within this you will find two folders that display the following:
1. Dingel & Neiman -- this displays all relevant information used to update the 2020 O*NET Rankings from "How Many Jobs Can be Done at Home?" to the most recently available full year, 2022.
2. Occ, Wage Data for 15 Cities -- this displays all datasets and .do Stata files used to merge datasets for the fifteen selected MSAs for this thesis and create city-level O*NET Rankings.
3. Full Regression.do shows the merging of all city-merged .dta sets and the subsequent final regression.
